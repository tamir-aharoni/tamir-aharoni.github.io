### **Tamir Aharoni**

*Creative Director | R&D Thinker | AI Specialist*

### **[Intro Section]**

Hello, I’m Tamir, a creative lead, animation director, and writer.

I work at the intersection of storytelling, design, and emerging technology. I build worlds, engaging characters, and the systems to bring them to life.

My background spans web series, short films, and experimental R&D. I’ve led AI-driven pipelines for animation, collaborated with engineers to develop creative workflows, and written and performed work that continues to resonate with audiences.

Most recently, I was Creative Lead at Alma Studios, a stealth-mode startup, where I helped build a generative pipeline powering over 100 original YouTube channels. While the project focused on testing scalable content systems, my role centered on designing tools and workflows that ensured creative consistency, narrative identity, and emotional impact - not just mass production.

Earlier, I co-created and co-hosted *The Dictators*, a successful comedic web series for Kan Public Broadcasting Corporation. The show still draws a dedicated YouTube following today.

I thrive in creative R&D spaces where story meets systems, and experiments lead to something surprising and meaningful.

### **[Case Study: Alma]**

**How I Helped Build the Creative Engine Behind 100 YouTube Channels**

At Alma Studios, I was tasked with testing a radical question:  
Can AI-powered workflows produce emotionally resonant animation at scale, without compromising originality or quality?

The goal: launch 100 original YouTube channels, each uploading daily animated lyric videos, and reach 1,000 subscribers per channel. My role focused on crafting tools, processes, and creative safeguards that preserved each channel’s identity and voice.

**Highlights:**

* Designed a modular prompt architecture to generate songs, lyrics, visuals, and lore-aligned characters  
* Created a scalable style guide for thumbnails and brand cohesion  
* Built multi-stage prompt flows with R&D, balancing consistency with surprise and freshness  
* Planned a viewer-feedback loop to generate ideas directly from the audience and turn them into new episodes

**Results:**

* Our first channel reached 1,000 subscribers and monetization within a month  
* Scaled to 100 unique, functioning channels with distinct identities  
* Proved that automation and engaging storytelling can coexist when the systems are designed with intention

### **[Creative R&D Experiments]**

**“What Makes a Hero?” (Kan Kids)**  
*Micro-Team, Micro-Time, Maximum Impact*  
Creating a children’s short in 2 months. Self-taught advanced rigging in After Effects to retain the handmade feel of the original illustrations.  
→ Nominated for *Best Children's Short Film* at Animix 2025  
→ Delivering two behind-the-scenes workshops at the festival

**“The Onboarding” (MA Project)**  
*Game x Animation x Corporate Satire*  
An absurdist, interactive installation built in Unity and TouchDesigner. The player navigates a surreal onboarding process while dodging distractions, performance anxiety, and quirky co-workers.  
→ Designed and developed all animation, code logic, and narrative flow using Touchdesigner, Unity and real-time OCM messaging

**“The Dictators” (Kan Web Series)**  
*Humor x History x Lasting Impact*  
Co-created, wrote, and hosted *The Dictators*, a comedic web series produced by Kan. Each episode explored the life, legacy, and propaganda of a historical dictator—from Gaddafi to Mobutu—through archival footage and storytelling.  
→ Combined sharp writing, humor, and history to make complex topics accessible  
→ Built a dedicated fanbase; episodes are still widely viewed and shared

### **[Tools I Use]**

I see AI as a creative collaborator, not a replacement, that helps us sketch faster, iterate smarter, and challenge assumptions.

**Animation & Post:** After Effects, Photoshop, Blender  
**AI Visuals:** Midjourney, Runway, Krea (Flux), Kling 2.1, Veo 3  
**AI Sound & Voice:** Suno, 11Labs  
**Vibe Coding & Prompt Engineering:** Cursor, Claude  
**Writing & Ideation:** ChatGPT, GPT pipelines, manual writing (still undefeated)

### **[About Me]**

Outside the studio, I’m a two-time Israeli Poetry Slam champion and world finalist. I’ve performed internationally, blending humor, rhythm, and emotional precision on stages in France, Italy, Canada, and beyond.

I’m also a mountain climber and lifelong traveler. After my military service, I co-authored a trekking guide to the southern Jordanian desert with Boaz Langford, a geologist, cave explorer, and mentor.

These experiences shaped how I see creative work: as exploration, as navigation, and sometimes as survival.

### **[Call to Action]**

**I’m looking for my next adventure!**

I want to join teams building the future of creative expression. Whether that's:

* **Narrative-Driven Products** - creating experiences where story and function are inseparable  
* **AI Creative Collaboration** - designing tools where humans and AI create together, not in competition  
* **Experimental Media** - pushing boundaries of how stories can be told  
* **Creative Tools for Makers** - building platforms that help creators work better, faster, more intuitively

If you're rethinking creativity in the age of AI, designing for emotional depth, or building tools that empower storytellers, I’d love to talk.
